  Scope:     Full review of src/App.jsx (617 lines), package.json, public/index.html
             and the live deployed product.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ai-costings tool is a focused, well-executed internal React application that
generates branded AI self-checkout supplier quotes and PDF documents for Compass
UK&I Digital. For its stated purpose it works correctly and presents a polished,
professional interface. The deliberate single-file architecture is appropriate for
the current scope and the PDF output is high-quality and on-brand.

However, several issues warrant attention before the tool grows further. The most
pressing concerns are: (1) the Create React App toolchain is deprecated and will
accumulate unpatched vulnerabilities over time; (2) there is no access control on
what is an internal pricing tool publicly accessible on the internet; (3) coding
style prioritises extreme density over readability, creating maintenance risk;
and (4) pricing constants are scattered as raw magic numbers through business
logic with no mechanism to update them without a full code deploy.

The product itself is UX-positive but lacks mobile responsiveness, has no
feedback loop after PDF generation, and conflates the "site contact" and
"prepared by" fields in PDF output. These are small but addressable issues.

Overall maturity: EARLY STAGE / INTERNAL TOOL — functional and fit for current
purpose, but carrying meaningful technical debt that should be resolved before
scope is expanded significantly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  SECTION 1 — CODE QUALITY
  Severity: MEDIUM

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:
  The code is functional and the architectural choice of a single file is
  defensible for this scope. However, the coding style leans heavily toward
  extreme compression: variable names are single letters or two-character
  abbreviations, the CSS block is a single minified-style string, JSX lines
  routinely exceed 200 characters, and the entire reset() function is one line
  ~180 characters long. This style makes the code fast to write but slow to
  read, debug, and modify — particularly under time pressure or when handed to
  a new developer. There is also a light duplication of pricing data in the
  JSX (unit price hints on the Quantities step mirror calcQuote() constants
  and could silently diverge).

Specific findings and suggestions:

  1. Rename single-letter and highly abbreviated variables throughout App.jsx.
     Examples to address:
       - `B`  → `lineItems`          (calcQuote accumulator array)
       - `hw` → `hardwareTotal`      (running hardware sum)
       - `ins`→ `installTotal`
       - `ann`→ `annualTotal`
       - `cap`→ `capitalTotal`
       - `d`  → `displayValue`       (AnimatedNumber state)
       - `p`  → `prevValue`          (AnimatedNumber ref)
       - `f`  → `animateFrame`       (rAF callback)
       - `si` → `stepIndex`
       - `sc` → `supplierColor`
       - `sr/sg/sb` → `[red,green,blue]`
     This alone would materially improve maintainability with zero runtime cost.

  2. Extract the hardcoded per-supplier price constants to named constants at
     the top of calcQuote() or as a separate PRICING object, rather than
     embedding raw numbers (3373, 4649.50, 1072.5, etc.) directly in add()
     calls. Unnamed magic numbers in financial calculations are a correctness
     risk: there is nothing to indicate which number maps to which line item
     without reading the surrounding code carefully.
     Example structure:
       const VISION_PRICES = {
         scanner: 3373,
         printer: 190,
         worldpayMid: 50,
         weighPay: 750,
         installFirst: 1750,
         installAdditional: 1072.5,
         softwareAnnual: 4649.5,
         eftCloud: 1583,
         worldpayPedAnnual: 116.52,
       };

  3. Break the reset() function across multiple lines. It currently chains
     ~12 state setters on one line (~180 chars) which is impossible to diff
     in a PR or scan for correctness. Vertical expansion costs nothing.

  4. The `css` constant (lines 393–468) is defined inside the App component
     body. This means a new string is allocated and the entire <style> block
     is re-evaluated by the browser on every state change / re-render. Move
     the css constant outside the App function (it does not reference any
     component state or props — the only dynamic value is `--sc` which is
     applied via inline style, not the CSS string itself).

  5. The Quantities step JSX (line 529) contains hardcoded price-per-unit
     display hints: `"£"+(supplier==="VISION_CHECKOUT"?"750":supplier===
     "AUTOCANTEEN"?"660":"695")`. These duplicate constants from calcQuote()
     and will silently become wrong when prices change. Derive them from a
     shared PRICING constant or from calcQuote output.

  6. The AnimatedNumber component (lines 356–364) packs import, state, ref,
     effect, and return all into 9 dense lines with no comments. It implements
     a custom easing animation loop that deserves at minimum a short comment
     explaining the easing formula (1 - (1-r)^3 cubic ease-out).

  7. CSS class names are highly abbreviated and context-dependent:
     `.bk-sec`, `.bk-row`, `.bk-title`, `.t-div`, `.wm`, `.fg`, `.fgrp`,
     `.btn-p`, `.btn-g`. With no CSS file and no BEM or naming convention,
     the meaning of any given class is only obvious to the original author
     within a short window. More descriptive names (e.g. `.breakdown-section`,
     `.totals-divider`, `.form-grid`, `.watermark`) would help significantly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  SECTION 2 — PERFORMANCE
  Severity: LOW

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:
  For a tool with a single user at a time generating one quote, performance is
  not a critical concern. However, there are several patterns that are
  technically inefficient and which would become meaningful issues if the
  component tree grew, or if AnimatedNumber were used more frequently.

Specific findings and suggestions:

  1. The `css` string is allocated inside the App component body (see also
     Code Quality item 4). Every state change (e.g. incrementing a scanner
     count) triggers a re-render which re-creates the string and causes the
     browser to re-parse the <style> block. This is the most impactful
     performance issue in the codebase. Moving `css` outside the component
     eliminates this entirely.

  2. Google Fonts are loaded via @import url() inside the injected <style>
     block (line 394). This is a render-blocking CSS import that fires on
     every re-render. Fonts should be loaded exclusively via <link> tags in
     public/index.html. The @import inside the inline style should be removed.

  3. AnimatedNumber's useEffect starts a requestAnimationFrame loop but never
     returns a cleanup function. If the value prop changes rapidly (e.g. the
     user rapidly increments/decrements a quantity on the summary page) multiple
     overlapping animation loops will run concurrently, all calling setD()
     against the same state. Add a cleanup: return () => cancelAnimationFrame
     (rafId) from the useEffect to prevent this.

  4. `result = step === "summary" ? calcQuote(...) : null` (line 389) is
     correct in gating the calculation to the summary step, but as written
     calcQuote() re-runs on every render while on the summary step (e.g.
     during the PDF download button hover animation). Wrap in useMemo with
     the input variables as dependencies to prevent unnecessary recalculation.

  5. The three base64 logo strings (lines 4–7) make the App.jsx source file
     extremely large (estimated ~100–200 KB of base64 per logo). While this
     is fine for a build artifact, it makes the source file slow to open and
     diff. Consider storing logos in public/ as PNG files and importing them
     normally — Create React App handles this correctly and the result is
     identical at runtime but far more manageable in source control.

  6. AnimatedNumber is not wrapped in React.memo. When the parent App re-renders
     (e.g. due to hover state on a button), AnimatedNumber re-renders
     unnecessarily and its useEffect may re-fire if referential equality is
     not maintained on the value prop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  SECTION 3 — SECURITY
  Severity: MEDIUM

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:
  The application has a small attack surface because it is entirely client-side
  with no backend, no authentication tokens, no database, and no API calls.
  User inputs are only used for display (in PDFs and the UI) and are never
  executed as code. There are no exposed credentials. However, two issues
  deserve attention: the tool is publicly accessible on the internet despite
  being an internal pricing tool, and the Create React App build chain (which
  is now unmaintained) will accumulate unpatched dependency vulnerabilities
  over time.

Specific findings and suggestions:

  1. The tool is deployed publicly at https://samwarb.github.io/ai-costings
     with no authentication, login, or IP restriction. It exposes current
     Compass pricing for three AI checkout suppliers (capital and annual costs
     per unit). This is a commercial pricing document for an internal sales
     process — competitors who discover the URL could access a complete
     breakdown of Compass's supplier rates. Mitigations to consider:
       a) Add HTTP Basic Auth via a Workers/Functions layer if hosting allows.
       b) Move the tool to an internal hosted URL (Azure Static Web Apps with
          AAD authentication, or similar).
       c) At minimum, add <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
          to public/index.html to prevent search engine indexing.

  2. `react-scripts` 5.0.1 / Create React App is effectively unmaintained
     (last meaningful release was 2022). Running `npm audit` will likely
     surface a growing list of dependency vulnerabilities in the build chain.
     These don't affect the production bundle directly (CRA vulns are mostly
     in dev tooling) but they are a compliance risk and will prevent `npm
     install` from completing cleanly in future CI environments. Consider
     migrating the build toolchain to Vite, which is actively maintained and
     a near-drop-in replacement for CRA.

  3. PDF filename sanitization at line 219/352:
       (siteInfo.siteName||"Quote").replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g,"_")
     This is correctly safe — it strips all non-alphanumeric characters.
     No action needed, noted here as a positive finding.

  4. Google Fonts are loaded from an external CDN (fonts.googleapis.com).
     For GDPR compliance, loading Google Fonts from an external URL sends
     the end-user's IP address to Google's servers. Since this is an internal
     tool this is low risk, but for full compliance either self-host the
     fonts in public/ or use a system font stack.

  5. There is no Content Security Policy configured. GitHub Pages does not
     allow custom HTTP headers, so this is a platform limitation rather than
     a code deficiency, but it is worth noting if the tool moves to a
     platform that supports CSP headers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  SECTION 4 — SCALABILITY
  Severity: MEDIUM

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:
  The single-file architecture is appropriate for the current scope (3 suppliers,
  6 wizard steps, ~617 lines). However, it is already showing signs of strain,
  and adding any significant new feature — a 4th supplier, a new pricing
  variable, a quote history view, a comparison mode — would require changes
  scattered across multiple tightly-coupled sections of App.jsx with no clear
  seams. The pricing model is also tightly coupled to the code, meaning any
  price change requires a developer to edit source code and trigger a full
  deployment.

Specific findings and suggestions:

  1. Hardcoded pricing with no external data source is the most significant
     scalability constraint. Every price update (which will happen when
     supplier contracts are renegotiated) requires: editing calcQuote() in
     source code, running a build, and deploying to GitHub Pages. This ties
     commercial pricing operations to the engineering pipeline. Consider
     extracting pricing to a JSON config (even a static file) that can be
     updated without touching application logic. This also enables auditing
     — there is currently no record of what prices were in force at any
     given time.

  2. Adding a 4th supplier currently requires changes in at least five
     separate locations: the SUPPLIERS constant, getSteps() if a new step
     type is needed, calcQuote() with a new if block, the Quantities step
     JSX (hardcoded price hints), and potentially the PDF builders. There
     is no single "supplier definition" object that owns all of these.
     A supplier registry pattern (one object per supplier that owns its
     name, color, logo, prices, and step config) would reduce this to one
     place.

  3. The CSS block (75+ rules, ~80 lines) inside the component will become
     unmanageable as new steps or UI elements are added. If the app grows
     materially, migrate to CSS Modules or a lightweight utility approach.

  4. There is no URL routing. Every navigation action is internal state only;
     the browser URL never changes. This means:
       - Users cannot bookmark or share a specific step or supplier.
       - The browser back button does not work as expected.
       - If the page is refreshed mid-wizard, the user is returned to step 1.
     For an internal tool with a simple linear flow this is acceptable, but
     it would be an immediate problem if the tool were embedded in a wider
     portal.

  5. There is no upper bound on quantity inputs (scanners, weighPays, smeDays).
     Setting scanners to a very large number (e.g. 50) would produce unusual
     but technically correct calculations, and may cause PDF layout overflow
     on the Summary PDF (which has no page-overflow protection).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  SECTION 5 — BUGS & ERROR HANDLING
  Severity: MEDIUM

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:
  For the normal happy path the application behaves correctly. However, several
  edge cases are unhandled: the AnimatedNumber component leaks animation frames
  on unmount, the Summary PDF has no pagination guard and will silently overflow
  the page with large quantities, PDF generation errors are completely silent,
  and the "Prepared by" field in PDFs reflects the wrong person. The supplier
  state change flow also leaves stale t2eExisting values in memory.

Specific findings and suggestions:

  1. AnimatedNumber (lines 358–362) starts a requestAnimationFrame loop
     in useEffect but returns no cleanup function. If the component unmounts
     before the animation completes (e.g. user navigates back from summary),
     the loop continues calling setD() on an unmounted component. In React
     18 this is a no-op rather than an error, but it wastes CPU and can cause
     stale closure bugs if value changes rapidly. Fix: capture the rAF ID
     and return a cleanup function:
       let rafId;
       const f = (now) => { ...; rafId = requestAnimationFrame(f); };
       rafId = requestAnimationFrame(f);
       return () => cancelAnimationFrame(rafId);

  2. The Summary PDF (makeSummaryPDF) has no overflow / pagination logic.
     Content is drawn at increasing y coordinates with no check for
     exceeding the A4 height (297mm). With a large number of annual line
     items (e.g. Deligo with many scanners) the content will be drawn
     beyond the page boundary and silently clipped. The Breakdown PDF has
     an overflow check (`if (y > H-42) { doc.addPage(); y = 15; }`) but
     does not redraw the column headers or section styling on the new page,
     leaving continuation pages unstyled.

  3. There is no error handling around PDF generation. If jsPDF throws for
     any reason (e.g. a corrupt base64 string, an out-of-memory condition),
     the button click silently fails with no feedback to the user. Wrap
     makeSummaryPDF() and makeBreakdownPDF() calls in try/catch blocks and
     display a user-visible error message.

  4. When a user selects Deligo (triggering the t2e step), sets T2E status,
     then navigates back and switches to a different supplier, the
     t2eExisting state variable retains its previously set value (true or
     false) until the wizard is fully reset. This does not cause incorrect
     calculations because non-Deligo suppliers do not use t2eExisting in
     calcQuote(), but it is invisible dirty state. The t2e step UI could
     be re-rendered unexpectedly if supplier switching logic changes. Fix:
     reset t2eExisting to null in the supplier selection handler when a
     non-Deligo supplier is chosen.

  5. The "Prepared by" cell in both PDFs (Summary: line 135, Breakdown:
     implied via meta row) is populated with `siteInfo.contactName`. This
     field is labelled "Contact Name" in the UI and intended to capture the
     client-side contact, not the Compass employee generating the quote.
     A quote document that lists a client contact as "Prepared by" is
     potentially confusing or unprofessional. Add a separate "Prepared by"
     or "Account Manager" field to the site info step.

  6. The go-live date field (type="date") has no minimum date constraint.
     A user can select a date in the past, which would produce a PDF with a
     historic target go-live date. Add a `min` attribute set to today's
     date:  min={new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0]}

  7. In calcQuote(), if supplier is somehow null or an unrecognised string,
     none of the if blocks execute and the function returns a quote with all
     zeros plus contingency of 0. No error is thrown and no indication is
     given to the caller. Given the function is only called when step ===
     "summary" and a supplier is always set at that point, this is unlikely
     to surface in practice, but a guard at the top of calcQuote would make
     the failure explicit rather than silent.

  8. The fmt() and fmtN() formatting utilities coerce their argument to a
     number with (+n). If n is undefined or NaN (e.g. from a future state
     change that misses an initialisation), the output will be "NaN" rendered
     directly into the UI or PDF with no guard. Assertions or a fallback
     (|| 0) would prevent this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  SECTION 6 — DOCUMENTATION
  Severity: LOW

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:
  Documentation has improved significantly with the addition of CLAUDE.md.
  The file is comprehensive and accurate. However, the source code itself
  has almost no inline documentation — the business logic in calcQuote(),
  the animation maths in AnimatedNumber, and the PDF coordinate layout are
  all undocumented. For a file that is intentionally monolithic and expected
  to be the sole maintenance surface, inline comments are more valuable than
  in a conventionally split codebase.

Specific findings and suggestions:

  1. calcQuote() contains all financial logic but has no comments explaining
     the business rules. At a minimum, each supplier block and the universal
     costs section should have a comment. The implementation fee formula
     (£1,250 + smeDays × £300) and the 2.5% contingency rate should be
     clearly labelled as the constants they are, not derived by reading the
     arithmetic.

  2. AnimatedNumber implements a cubic ease-out animation using the formula
     `ease = 1 - (1 - r)^3`. This is non-obvious to anyone unfamiliar with
     easing functions. A one-line comment would make this immediately
     understandable without needing to derive the formula from the code.

  3. The Deligo-specific t2eExisting conditional logic (line 64:
     `if (!t2eExisting) ann += add("Annual","Control Desk Fee",625,1)`)
     is the only supplier-specific conditional cost in the entire pricing
     engine and warrants a comment explaining the business rule.

  4. The PDF builder functions use implicit coordinate arithmetic throughout
     (e.g. `y += 46`, `y += 11`, `y += 8`). These are correct but opaque —
     it is impossible to know what visual element a given y offset corresponds
     to without running the code. Section-level comments (e.g.
     "// Info grid — 40mm tall, starts at y=44") would help significantly
     when modifying PDF layout.

  5. The CSS class names should be documented. A short comment block above
     the css string listing the major sections (layout, header, wizard steps,
     form, summary, PDF panel) would make it much easier to navigate.

  6. CLAUDE.md is thorough and accurate — no changes needed beyond keeping
     it in sync when pricing is updated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  SECTION 7 — PRODUCT & UX
  Severity: MEDIUM

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:
  The product is visually polished and the wizard flow is clear and well-paced.
  Supplier brand theming throughout the UI is a strong touch. The PDF output
  is professional and would stand up to client-facing review. The primary UX
  gaps are: no feedback after PDF generation, a broken browser back-button
  experience, no mobile layout, and a "Prepared by" field that identifies the
  wrong person.

Specific findings and suggestions:

  1. There is no feedback after a PDF is downloaded. The download button
     triggers the file save dialog but returns immediately with no visual
     confirmation ("✓ Downloaded" state, brief toast, or button label change).
     Users may click the button multiple times believing the first click
     did nothing, generating duplicate files.

  2. The browser back button does not work. Because navigation is managed
     via React state with no URL changes, pressing the browser's native back
     button leaves the wizard entirely rather than going to the previous step.
     This is a common frustration for users who instinctively use browser
     navigation. Adding react-router (or even manual history.pushState calls)
     would resolve this.

  3. The layout is not mobile-responsive. The supplier selection grid uses
     `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)` regardless of viewport width.
     On a phone or small tablet, the three supplier cards will be very narrow
     and the logos may be unreadable. The SME day and quantities rows are
     fine on mobile, but the form grid (`grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr`)
     on the site info step will also be cramped. A simple media query
     switching both grids to single-column below 520px would fix this.

  4. The cost-per-SME-day (£300/day) is not surfaced on the SME days step.
     Users incrementing the day count have no way to know the marginal cost
     of each additional day without proceeding to the summary. Showing
     "£300 / day" as a sub-label (similar to the unit price hints on the
     quantities step) would help users make an informed decision.

  5. The progress bar step count reflects the Deligo extra step correctly
     (6 steps vs 5), but the step labels ("Step 2 of 5", etc.) give no
     indication of what step name is coming next. A label showing the
     current step name (e.g. "Step 2 of 5 — Quantities") would improve
     orientation.

  6. On the summary step, the only navigation options are "← Adjust" (goes
     to siteinfo, one step back) and "Start Over" (resets everything). There
     is no way to jump directly to the quantities or SME step from the
     summary without navigating step by step. For a quote tool where users
     frequently want to compare "what if I add a scanner", this friction
     matters.

  7. The "Prepared by" label in the generated PDF (Summary, right-hand info
     grid) is populated with `contactName`, which the UI labels as "Contact
     Name" — implying the client contact. A Compass employee preparing a
     quote for a client contact is a different person from the contact
     themselves. This creates an awkward PDF where the client contact appears
     to have prepared their own quote. Add an "Account Manager / Prepared by"
     field distinct from "Contact Name".

  8. The fixed-position watermark logo (`.wm`: `position:fixed; bottom:1.5rem;
     right:1.5rem`) may overlap scrollable content on screens where the
     wizard card is tall (e.g. long summary or site info step on a small
     monitor). Consider `position:absolute` relative to the page container
     or reducing the z-index so it sits definitively behind all interactive
     elements.

  9. Emoji are used in the PDF download button labels (📄 📋) which is a
     minor inconsistency with the otherwise clean, typographically precise
     design language. Plain SVG icons would be more consistent with the rest
     of the UI.

  10. The live site is not indexed-blocked. An internal pricing tool deployed
      to a public GitHub Pages URL with no robots directive may appear in
      search results, exposing commercial pricing information. Add:
        <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
      to public/index.html.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  SECTION 8 — TECHNICAL DEBT
  Severity: HIGH

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:
  The most significant piece of technical debt is the Create React App
  toolchain, which is no longer maintained and will become an increasing
  liability. Beyond that, hardcoded pricing, the growing single-file
  architecture, and lack of quote persistence represent debt that will
  compound as the tool is used more widely and extended.

Specific findings and suggestions:

  1. [HIGH] Create React App (react-scripts 5.0.1) is deprecated.
     The project was archived in 2023 and receives no further updates.
     Running `npm audit` against the project's dependencies is likely to
     return dozens of vulnerabilities in the dev dependency tree. This
     will worsen over time. The recommended migration path is Vite:
       npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
     Vite is a near-drop-in replacement for CRA, is actively maintained,
     builds ~10x faster, and produces smaller bundles. This migration
     should be prioritised before the project grows further.

  2. [HIGH] Hardcoded pricing constants embedded in business logic.
     There is no audit trail for price changes — when a supplier renegotiates
     rates, the old values are simply overwritten in calcQuote() with no
     record of what they were or when they changed. A generated quote cannot
     be reproduced after a price update. Extract pricing to a versioned
     JSON config file (even committed to the repo) so that the history of
     price changes is preserved in git history and prices can be updated
     without touching application logic.

  3. [MEDIUM] Single-file architecture approaching its natural limit.
     At 617 lines (excluding the multi-kilobyte base64 strings on lines 4–7,
     which inflate the actual file size significantly), the file is already
     difficult to navigate. Recommended extraction points when next refactoring:
       - calcQuote()        → src/pricing.js
       - makeSummaryPDF()   → src/pdfSummary.js
       - makeBreakdownPDF() → src/pdfBreakdown.js
       - CSS string         → src/App.module.css (or src/styles.js)
       - SUPPLIERS / PRICING constants → src/constants.js
     The React component (App, AnimatedNumber) would remain in App.jsx, now
     focused solely on UI logic.

  4. [MEDIUM] Base64 logos embedded in source code.
     Lines 4–7 of App.jsx contain base64 strings for four logos. Each logo
     is likely 30–150 KB of base64 text, making the raw source file very
     large and slow to open, diff, or code-review. They are also opaque —
     it is impossible to visually verify a base64 string is correct.
     Store logos as PNG files in public/images/ and reference them with
     standard img src paths. CRA (and Vite) handle this correctly.

  5. [MEDIUM] No quote persistence or history.
     Once a user navigates away or refreshes, the quote is lost. For a tool
     used in sales conversations, the ability to recall and re-download a
     previously generated quote would be valuable. A simple approach would
     be serialising quote state to localStorage on the summary step, allowing
     a "load last quote" option on the landing page. A more robust approach
     would be a lightweight backend (Cloudflare Worker + KV or similar).

  6. [LOW] Google Fonts loaded twice.
     The @import url() in the css string (line 394) requests Google Fonts.
     If public/index.html also includes <link rel="preconnect"> for
     fonts.googleapis.com (which it likely does per the project setup), the
     browser will establish the connection twice: once from the preconnect
     hint and again from the CSS @import when the <style> tag is injected.
     Remove the @import from the css string and load fonts exclusively via
     <link> tags in index.html.

  7. [LOW] No CI/CD pipeline.
     The deployment process is a manual `npm run deploy` run from a local
     machine. There is no automated build, lint check, or test gate on push.
     A minimal GitHub Actions workflow that runs `npm run build` on every
     push to master would catch build/lint errors before they reach
     production.

  8. [LOW] package.json version is 1.0.0 and has not been incremented.
     While version bumping is low-priority for an internal tool, it means
     there is no way to identify which version is deployed in production
     short of checking git history. Consider adopting a simple versioning
     discipline (even date-based: 2026.02) to make deployed-version
     identification easier.
